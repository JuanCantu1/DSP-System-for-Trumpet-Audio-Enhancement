# **DSP System for Trumpet Audio Enhancement** ðŸŽºâœ¨  

### **Overview**  
This project aims to develop a **real-time digital signal processing (DSP) system** on an FPGA to enhance trumpet audio. The system will implement features such as **reverb**, **echo removal**, and **pitch correction**, all processed entirely on the FPGA. It uses the DE1-SoC development board and integrates with the onboard WM8731 audio codec for audio input and output.

### **Features**  
- **Real-Time Audio Processing:** Enhance trumpet audio in real time.  
- **DSP Effects:**  
  - **Reverb:** Simulates room acoustics.  
  - **Echo Removal:** Suppresses unwanted echoes and background noise from the microphone.  
  - **Pitch Correction:** Adjusts pitch for audio refinement.  
- Fully implemented on the FPGA for high performance and low latency.  

### **Current Status**  
**This project is currently in progress.**  
- System architecture and DSP algorithm design are underway.
- The **WM8731 audio codec** is being set up for audio input and output. 
- Initial testing with synthetic sine wave signals is being set up.

### **Future Work**  
- Implement and test DSP algorithms for reverb, echo removal, and pitch correction.  
- Integrate live microphone input for real-time audio processing.  
- Optimize system performance and minimize latency.

### **Conclusion**
This project is an exciting exploration of FPGA-based DSP systems, combining music, engineering, and creativity to produce enhanced trumpet audio. By the end of this project, we aim to create a robust, real-time audio processing system that can be used in live performances or recordings.
