# 🎺 FPGA-Based Digital Signal Processor for Trumpet Audio Enhancement  

### 📍 Overview
This project develops a **real-time audio enhancement system for trumpet** using the **DE1-SoC FPGA**.  
It combines **Python-based frequency detection** with **Verilog-based DSP modules** to enhance live trumpet sound in hardware.  
The system currently simulates all DSP modules in Vivado and interfaces through Python for signal analysis and audio verification.  

🎯 **Goal:** Create a modular FPGA pipeline capable of real-time **autotune, reverb, compression, noise gating, and tonal enhancement** — optimized for brass performance.

Each block can be toggled independently from the **top-level module `audio_processor.v`**, enabling flexible experimentation and effect chaining.

### 🔧 Design Summary

The system is composed of modular **Verilog DSP blocks** and a **Python-based front end** for preprocessing and analysis.  
The FPGA operates entirely in fixed-point arithmetic, streaming one 16-bit audio sample per clock cycle.  

| Module | Description | Control Signal |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `noise_gate` | Suppresses background noise below threshold | `enable_noise_gate` |
| `autotune` | Detects pitch and corrects to nearest musical note | `enable_autotune` |
| `tone_filter` | Smooths transitions, reduces harsh tones | `enable_tone_filter` |
| `reverb` | Adds room ambience and spatial depth | `enable_reverb` |
| `compressor` | Balances dynamic range of performance | `enable_compressor` |
| `resonator` | Adds formant resonance to enhance brightness | `enable_resonator` |
| `trumpet_warmer` | Adds analog-style harmonic warmth | `enable_warmer` |
| `harmonic_exciter` | Restores lost overtones in filtered signals | `enable_exciter` |

Each module has adjustable parameters (thresholds, hold times, gain factors, mix ratios), allowing easy customization.

### 🧠 Simulation and Analysis Workflow

1. **Audio Preprocessing (Python)**
   - Convert `.wav` → `.mem` for Verilog simulation.  
   - Normalize amplitudes and segment test samples.  

2. **FPGA Simulation (Vivado XSIM)**
   - Feed `.mem` vectors into `audio_tb.v`.  
   - Enable or disable modules via control signals.  
   - Output processed audio as `.mem`.  

3. **Post-Processing (Python)**
   - Convert `.mem` → `.wav` for playback.  
   - Plot waveform and spectrogram comparisons.

### 🎧 Example: Trumpet C Scale Processing

A real trumpet **C scale recording** was used as a test case for pipeline validation.  
Below are waveform and spectrogram comparisons before and after DSP processing.

Each module is instantiated within the top-level `audio_processor.v` as a **streaming DSP chain**, operating at 48 kHz sample rate.  
Simulation results confirm sub-15 ms latency across the entire path, suitable for real-time performance.
